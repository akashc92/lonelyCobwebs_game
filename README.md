This project demonstrates a tiny interactive fiction engine supporting inventory mechanics. The _descriptions_ of a location and the _choices_ present at that location can be filtered by requiring the player to be _with_ or _without_ certain items. Locations may _provide_ or _consume_ items upon arrival.

The shortest way to end the story is follow all the red shaded option buttons, that makes the character act aggressively when Peter arrives.
